Now that we understand how to build a model, time to improve on the previous exmaple by including more criteria. Rather then just a bird and forest, let's compare airplanes, automobiles, cats, dogs and birds. Two different categories of objects, transportation and pets, and within these two categories are unique classes. Rather than distinguish between two vastly different classes, it now has two differentiate similar features betweeen living creatuers, as well as the similarites between planes and cars. 

To generate images, DuckDuckGo was incorparated. It was able to succesffuly gather roughly 200 unique images of each class.

The image above showing clearly that all classes were sucessfully found online. 

After constructing the model similar to the previous post, it was time to test it on a new data set.
