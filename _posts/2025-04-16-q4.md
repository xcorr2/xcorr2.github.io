excerpt: t-SNE and confusion matrices
---

The model created in the previous post was capable of detecting planes, cars, cats, dogs and birds in images. Using the testing data, an accuracy rate of 98.4% was detected. This was a very high accuracy rate, however birds were struggling to be detected. With just the accuracy result, there is no way of determining why birds were struggling to be detected. However there are 2 tools which can visualise potential pitfuls. 

# T-SNE
T-SNE, t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding, allows the separation of data that can not be defined by a straight line. The data set collected represents this non-linear data type. Each class is different with its own classifications cannot be combined between classes using linear methods. Instead t-SNE allows data to converted into a new space that is comparable amongst all data while, importantly, maintaining patterns and localisation of data. As a result, if the model represents classes in unique ways, then each class should be localised around a point or value that differs from others. 

The following plot was generated using the test data:

What can be observed is clumps of colours mostly segregated. Ideally data points within a class may be closer however the important observation was the distinct different localised areas for each class. Some points were outside of their expected areas, such as green points mixed between cats and planes. While this is an inaccuracies in the mode, the resulting plot meant these inaccuracies can be better detected. There is no uncertainty about what the modelling is confusing it with now. It has no problem differentiating it between other classes, for example birds do not localise around cars, and instead provides specific areas for improvements in the model.

# Confusion matrix

The confusion matrix provides a similar result to t-SNE. It will present the true and false postive rates of the test data, specifically highlighting which class was incorrectly idenfitied as which.

The resulting matrix achieved from the test data showed a mostly diagonal line which is ideal. It implies that model is producing the correct probablity to match the real values. However, again, birds are not entirely accurate being confused with cats in 4 instances. This again provides useful data for improvements on the model.
