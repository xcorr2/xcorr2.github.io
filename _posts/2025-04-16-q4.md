excerpt: t-SNE and confusion matrices

The model created in the previous post was capable of detecting planes, cars, cats, dogs and birds in images. Using the testing data, an accuracy rate of 98.4% was detected. This was a very high accuracy rate, however birds were struggling to be detected. With just the accuracy result, there is no way of determining why birds were struggling to be detected. However there are 2 tools which can visualise potential pitfuls.
