excerpt: t-SNE and confusion matrices
---

The model created in the previous post was capable of detecting planes, cars, cats, dogs and birds in images. Using the testing data, an accuracy rate of 98.4% was detected. This was a very high accuracy rate, however birds were struggling to be detected. With just the accuracy result, there is no way of determining why birds were struggling to be detected. However there are 2 tools which can visualise potential pitfuls. 

# T-SNE
Finding the problem is difficult, and the best way to solve class overlap is through visualisation. 

The result of the T-SNE plot should result, for five different classes, in five different distinct clumps of points. Each class should be differentiated by different features and the model should be able to create a classification such that when plotted the classes should not overlap. The plot below highlights five distinct clumps, as indicated by colours.

What can be observed however is a few green dots, which represent birds, very seperated from most other bird points.
