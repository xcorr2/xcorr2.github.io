# Adventures with fast ai

How can the average joe detect an object in any image? Well with fastai of course! This deep-learning library provides users high level capabilities with low level required knowledge. Utilising PyTorch, this library is simple to use and dynamic enough to give most anyone a tool to access to world of image processing. This blog details the process of creating an object detector based on five different classes of objects.
